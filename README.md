# Solutions to Competitive Programming Practice  problems

It includes solutions to both practice and contest problems from:
![Codeforces](https://img.shields.io/badge/Codeforces-445f9d?style=for-the-badge&logo=Codeforces&logoColor=white)

This repository is personal, made public in the hope that someone may find it useful, but:
- Solutions may be broken or not work for you.
- Solutions may not be best in algorithmic complexity terms.
- Solutions may have been written in a rush during a contest and may not make any sense.

So, in summary, if a solution seems stupid, it probably is.

feel free to fork / create your own if you want to share better / other solutions.

I do try to include only working solutions , written by me.
If you find any mistake or Syntax error,
please let me know and I'll fix it.
